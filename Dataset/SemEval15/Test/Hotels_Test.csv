My family had 5 rooms at this hotel for one night.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"One room was on one floor, 3 were on another, and the last was way up top.","[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
Being way spread out would have been OK until we got to the rooms.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
All 4 lower rooms were 80 degrees and above.,"[{'term': 'rooms', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
We were assured that the rooms would be cool by the time we got back from our concert.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
After the concert we had to change 4 of the rooms twice trying to find cooler floors.,"[{'term': 'rooms', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
We finally gave up at 12:30 a.m. with a room that was 77 degrees - still too warm.,"[{'term': 'room', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
And the room did not even have a shower curtain!,"[{'term': 'room', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"I understand they are going through renovations, but they need to either do it floor by floor and close that floor or close the entire hotel until finished.","[{'term': 'hotel', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
The only nice thing was the free shuttle to America West Arena.,"[{'term': 'shuttle', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Very disappointing,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
Lots of services promised and not provided.,"[{'term': 'services', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"The shuttle wasn't running, and the restaurant was closed down - both of those explained to me with because business is low right now around the holidays.","[{'term': 'shuttle', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'restaurant', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
So I guess you should make sure it's going to be busy when you go!,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
"The business center has been taken apart - the front desk staff did not know if it was going to be back, since they had no idea it had been taken apart and were quite shocked to find out, when they tried to let me in to use it.","[{'term': 'business center', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'front desk staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
Vending machines were out of everything except in the lobby.,"[{'term': 'Vending machines', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
Staff was very friendly and a bit embarrassed about everything that wasn't available.,"[{'term': 'Staff', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
The room itself was fine.,"[{'term': 'room', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Pay extra and stay somewhere else,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
This has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in!,"[{'term': 'hotel', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
And I was there 20 days on business needless to say I didnt pay for it!,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"

"Great hotel, great location, great price","[{'term': 'hotel', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'location', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'hotel', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
I had a great time at this hotel and did not experience any of what the bad reviews are about.,"[{'term': 'hotel', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were large and comfortable, the free breakfast was great, and the location downtown was excellent.","[{'term': 'staff', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'rooms', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'breakfast', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'location', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
The free shuttle to and from the airport saved us over 30 dollars alone in taxi cab fare (Phoenix Taxi fares are ridiculously expensive) and is also available anywhere downtown.,"[{'term': 'noaspectterm', 'polarity': 'none'}]"
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in downtown Phoenix.,"[{'term': 'hotel', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
